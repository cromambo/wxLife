Temporary (and easiest/fastest) solution is to disable manifest generation during development and enable it again in the release stage. Although this disables XP/Vista-style gui for the app (controls look like in "classic mode").




do i have a race hazard between my two timers, one creates bitmap, other uses it to paint screen? or are the functions allowed to finish, if i do, i could lock the image and not paint it but that would delay the paint, or use a buffer bitmap (but then how do i know that isnt in the middle of beind drawn to?)

advantages of static over paint:
control object to capture the mouse - make it into just a panel and get all the same benefits cause panel and control are both windows

paint over static:
no flicker!

statuc or paintdc:
can do partial redraw or make it piecemeal either cause of blit bitmap to paint

 status bar tooltip updates
 
 change has to stay cause its needed for each calculation
redraw has to be reset. why??????
else each frame will redraw the changed ones even if its already done it

redraw needs to be set on changed value or changed adjacent
changed also needs to be ran on both of them
